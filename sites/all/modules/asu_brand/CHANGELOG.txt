CHANGELOG for ASU Brand module for Drupal 7

ASU Brand 7.x-1.0
- Initial non-beta release.
- Made https://asu.edu/asuthemes the default base path so the module will work
  out-of-box on hosting environments that do not have AFS access.
- Checks if theme files are able to be loaded. If there is already data in the
  cache, then just continue to use it.
- Added link to list of templates to the block configuration form.

ASU Brand 7.x-1.0-beta3
- Include global $base_path in $asu_sso_signinurl and $asu_sso_signouturl for
  installations that are not in the root web directory.

ASU Brand 7.x-1.0-beta2
- Update Sign Out link when CAS is not enabled.
- Remove WebAuth compatibility since this module is for drupal 7 sites
and WebAuth won't be supported for drupal 7.
- Fix bug where if you changed the footer color to something other
than black and then back to black, a warning to enter a color value was triggered.

ASU Brand 7.x-1.0-beta1
- Initial beta release of the ASU Brand module.
